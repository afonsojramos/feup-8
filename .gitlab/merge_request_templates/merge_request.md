## By submitting this MR, I have verified the following:

- [ ] Added descriptive name to MR
  - Your PR should NOT be called `Update index.md`, since it does not help the maintainer understand what has been changed.
- [ ] I have tested that the branch was working before creating a merge request.

<!-- TO NOTE

1. Avoid a duplicate MR by searching through the open pull requests to check that there is not a PR already open that writes the same article or makes similar changes.

2. If you edit a stub article, ensure your changes are substantial enough to justify removing the stub text (the "This article is a stub..." part).

3. We can't accept MRs that only add links to the "More Information" section. A repository script will automatically delete any changes (and revert it to the stub template) if the stub language is still in that file.

4. Your changes must pass the GitLab CI build.
