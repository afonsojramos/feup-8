PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges. It is being used in FEUP for teaching young programmers at Univ. Junior, and for dynamizing game construction at Game Jams. We intend to have an open-source clone, more suitable for education.
